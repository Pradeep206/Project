# Movie Recommendation Using Machine Learning
This is a movie recommendation project that uses Content-based filtering to recommend movies to users. Content-based recommendation systems are a type of recommendation system that recommends items to users based on the similarity between the content of the items. In other words, it recommends items that are similar in content to the items that the user has shown interest in.

The dataset used for this project is the [Netflix](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alcham/netflix-dataset) dataset, which contains 8807 shows and movies. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set.
